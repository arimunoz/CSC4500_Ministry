Basic Syntax for Triggers:
CREATE TRIGGER triggerName triggerTime triggerEvent 
ON tableName
FOR EACH ROW

BEGIN
............
END;

For triggerName: is the name of a trigger; you can
call it whatever the purpose of that trigger.

For triggerTime: to activate the trigger; you need
to state BEFORE or AFTER activation time for the 
trigger

For triggerEvent: it is an event so the trigger can
be invoked; you can do that by INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE
*If a triggerEvent needs to be invoked in many events then
there has to be multiple triggers; one for each event.
