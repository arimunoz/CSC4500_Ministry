To make a branch so you don't commit to master:
Create a branch name. And please name the branch to what your committing it to.

git branch branchname //what your working on all one string
git checkout branchName
git add .
git commit -m "commit-message"
git push -u origin branchName
------------push your branch to to master-----------
git push -u origin branchName
========================================================
Someone else will review your branchName and commit it to master.
Feel free to comment on the branch before commiting to master so we don't break it.
Thank you!
